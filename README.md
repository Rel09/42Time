### F.A.Q:
- Why does it require me to enter my Intra Infos?
```
This isn't using the 42 API. This is doing exactly the same as You logging on the intra and doing
the math, but much quicker.
Also, once you're logged in, you can just type any 42 username to get their timestamp.
This only require you to log once to access the Intra.
```

Any suggestions is appreciated - Thanks
